                        It's a small little stand located in Little Italy - <u>1068 W Taylor St, Chicago, IL 60607</u>.

                    <p>What makes Mario's Italian Ice so special is that they use natural ingredients rather than artifical sweetners! <br>
                    That is something that I personally look out for as I am trying to fix my diet and eat healthier than I have in the past. <br></p>

                        Here my friend and I got a blue raspberry and raspberry ice tea. <br>
                        
                        It was 80 degrees outside and this was the perfect treat to cool off and have a unique desert that is healthy and tasty! <br>

                    <p>I can not stress enough how good this place is! If you are ever in town or visiting, <u>you must</u> put this on top of your to do list!</p>
